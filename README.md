# Bachelors-Project
In this project, we implemented some mutation testing functions that are suitable for neural networks and tested them on two widely used neural networks. The purpose of using mutation testing on neural networks was to test the quality of the test data. Since the main way of evaluating a NN is by testing it on test data, it is very important to make sure of the quality of the test dataset.

The convolutional neural networks (CNN) were implemented by Tensorflow, and we used MNIST data.

This is an implementation of this article: DeepMutation: Mutation Testing of Deep Learning Systems
